# 2 Running Linux  .... 00:29:09 ... re-watich again ..

- Go to https://hub.docker.com 
- search UBUNTU
- open ubuntu 
- <for each 'IMAGE , you see the command to pull that 'IMAGE on to your laptop ..>

# step 1 _____________________________________________________ RUN =  IMAGE ? RUN IMAGE : PULL IMAGE THEN RUN__________________________________



- we won't use the <pull> command ... we'll use a shortcut ... 

> docker run ubuntu

- if we have this <IMAGE> locally , docker will start a <container> with the image else 
    - Docker will <pull> the <IMAGE> behind the scene and then <start> a container .
- So the above command will pull the image from <docker hub ..>

> docker run ubuntu 
# Output

<p 'Error occured ...  docker started a container , but because we did not interact with this container , the 'container 'stoped >
<Let's prove the above Error> 

#  If we run docker ps to see the list of <running processer> or <running containers> 

> docker ps 

# Ouput 
It shows no containers running at the moment .. .

# if we run <docker ps -a > we can also see the <d  'stoped containers> also ..

> docker ps -a

<Now we even see the containers that have been stoped ..> 

 











 # To start a container  and interact with 

 > docker run -it  <namelocalimage> 

-it = short for interactive

- since we have already pulled the <ubuntu image> 

> docker run -it ubuntu

# Ouput 
root@8a3af281321e:/#
 

root@8a3af281321e:/# = <SHELL-PROMT> 

<SHELL is a program that takes our commands and passes them to the OS for execution>

- <d 'root = currently logged in user>
- <d '8a3af281321e = Name of machine>
So this container had this <ID(8a3af281321e)> which is auto generated by docker and in this case like the name of the <machine>
- <d / = where we are in the file system>
- <d '# = I have the highest privilages because i have logged in as the root user ... if It where a normal user , it would be '$ > 
- <We can execute a bunch of 'commands>

e.g 
root@8a3af281321e:/#      echo hello 
#  output  ... print's hello on terminal 
hello 

root@8a3af281321e:/#      whoami
# Ouput .... shows current user 
root 
     

<So this commands that we are running in the 'SHELL 'PROGRAM takes the command and passes them to the 'KERNEL for execution>

root@8a3af281321e:/#      echo $0 
# Ouput ... shows location of <d 'shell 'program> 
/bin/bash


- <bash = born against shell> 
    - steve born(the first person to create a shell program)
    - bash is the enhaced version of the original shell program

# NB ..
1 
- <d 'Linux = we use a '/' to separate files and directories> 
- <d 'Windows = we use a '\'> 

2 
- <d 'Linux = Is a 'case 'sensitive OS>
    - this is not limited to commands ... it's applicable anywhere




# we can use the history  to see all the commands we have executed lately ... 

root@8a3af281321e:/#     history 
# Ouput .... to see all the commands we have executed .. 
   1  echo hello
    2  whoami
    3  echo $0
    4  history

# We can replay any of these commands by running the command  number ... 

root@8a3af281321e:/#  !2

!2 = whoami










# NB .... 

> docker run -it  ubuntu
- pulls a new instance of ubuntu from the internet and runs ... 

OR ... 

> docker pull ubuntu 
- pulls an instance ... 
> docker start -i <containerID>
