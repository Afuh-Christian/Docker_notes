- some processes may be using alot of cpu time ...

E.g ...
1 __ create a process sleep in the background 
> sleep 1000 &

2 __ check the processes .. 
> ps 
 PID TTY          TIME CMD
    1 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
  294 pts/0    00:00:00 sleep
  295 pts/0    00:00:00 ps

3 __ kill the process 
> kill 294

4 check the processes again .. 
> ps 
 ps
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
    1 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
  296 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
[1]+  Terminated              sleep 100

<we have successfully created a process called 'sleep and 'killed it >
