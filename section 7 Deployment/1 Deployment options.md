# Deployment options              03:48:39.679

# There are two options to deploy a dockerised application .... 
- <1 'Single-host deployment>
    - disadvantage 
        - if the app goes offline , app will not be accessible 
        - Cannot  handle millions of users
- <2 'Cluster deployment (A group of servers )> 
    - Advantage 
        - High availability 
        - High scalability







# <d 'CLUSTER 'SOLUTIONS>  
- To run clusters you need a tool <called 'orchestration tools .............. docker has it's own 'orchestration tool called 'Docker 'Swarm> 

- But these days most people <use 'kubernetes (A google product) instead of 'Docker 'Swarm>



# - We will focus on a  single host deployment since clusters are complicated .......
